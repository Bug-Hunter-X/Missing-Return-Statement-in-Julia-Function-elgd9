# Julia Function Bug: Missing Return Statement

This repository demonstrates a common bug in Julia functions: a missing return statement in a conditional branch. The function `myfunction` is incomplete because it doesn't specify what happens if the input `x` is equal to 0.  This omission leads to an unexpected error when the function is called with `x = 0`.
